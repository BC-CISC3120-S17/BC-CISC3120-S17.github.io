    <h3>About CodeLab</h3>


    <p>CodeLab is a tool for learning programming. We'll use it in this
    class as a way for you to practice Java programming in a
    "low-stakes" environment&mdash;before I ask you to write code for
      a homework assignment or an exam.</p>


    <p>CodeLab exercises generally ask you to write a fairly small
    fragment of code, focusing on a particular language feature (how
    to declare variables, or how to write loops, or how to write a
    class). If your solution is incorrect, CodeLab gives you a lot of
      hints about what might be wrong&mdash; the hints
    aren't <em>always</em> helpful, but mostly they are. And it's way
      more helpful than the Java compiler.</p>

    <p>You can take as much time, and as many attempts, on each
    exercise as you need (up to the due date). Your grade on CodeLab
    will be based only on how many exercises you complete correctly. I
    expect to assign about three "batches" of exercises, all in the
      first half (roughly) of the semester.</p>

    <p>If you have trouble with any of the exercises (some of them are
      <em>very</em> picky, just like the compiler), you can email me
      to say that you're having trouble with exericse #xyz; I can log
      in to CodeLab and look at your submissions so far, and offer
      more hints.</p>


 <p>Registration codes will appear here shortly:</p>

 <p> If you're in the afternoon section, use code CUNY-25418-BEQU-31.</p>

 <p>If you're in the evening section, use code CUNY-25420-KJTU-310.</p>

 <p>(If you use the wrong code, you risk not getting a grade for your
 CodeLab work)</p>
