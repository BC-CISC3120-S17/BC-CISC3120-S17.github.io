        <h2>About Documentation and Style</h2>


        <p>The fundamental purpose of documentation is to enhance the readability
          of your code&mdash;that is, to make it easier for future
          readers of your code (very much including you-a-week-from-now)
          to understanding what your code is supposed to do. On this
          page, I describe my expectations for the readability of the
          code you submit to me.</p>

        <p><em>Style</em> refers primarily to the way your code
        appears on the screen/page. It also encompasses some ideas
        about the design of your code&mdash;mostly, techniques you
        should avoid because they are likely to break in the future.
        The Internet has many examples of excellent Java style guides;
          I recommend
        the <a href="https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/src/java/com/twitter/common/styleguide.md">GitHub
        Java Style Guide</a>. As you read through it, you will
        probably see many unfamiliar terms and concepts. Don't worry.
        Look for what the guide says about familiar elements of coding
        practice; when you come back to the guide later in the
        semester, you'll understand more&mdash;and if you return to it
        in a year, you'll understand even more.
</p>
        
        <p>
          <em>Documentation</em> refers to the non-executable text
          that describes the design and intended behavior of the
          executable part of your code. Style guides sometimes provide
          guidance about how to write and structure your
          documentation. Below, I describe what kinds of documentation
          you need to provide for projects in this class.
        </p>

        <p>Project documentation comes in three flavors:
            <ol>
                <li>In-line comments</li>
                <li>Javadoc comments</li>
                <li>Project README</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
          
        <h3>In-line comments</h3>

        <p>
        While good style dictates that your code be as
        "self-documenting" as possible, through the use of
        descriptive-but-brief variable names, it also dictates that you
        comment on anything that's not "obvious."
        </p>

        <h3>Javadoc comments</h3>

        <p>
            This is where most of your documentation effort should go.
            In the project skeletons I provide you, you will see some
            simple HTML documentation. This was produced 
            from my comments using Javadoc&mdash;note that class and method
            comments all begin with two stars and occasionally use
            javadoc notation like
            <code>@see</code>
            and
            <code>@param</code>
            . You should revise and augment this documentation as
            needed. See <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html#format">this explanation</a> of how doccomments are best written.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you want to see what your documentation looks like, in
            Eclipse look under the Project menu for "Generate
            JavaDoc..."&mdash;you shouldn't need to alter any of the
            default settings. Note that Git/GitHub will commit your
            documentation (in the
            <code>doc</code>
            folder) along with the rest of your project, though you
            may have to make sure the folder is included in your
            repository.
        </p>

        <h3>Project README</h3>

        I also ask you to edit the
        <code>README.md</code>
        file. It should be clear how to get started on writing this
        file, but for more information on how it can be formatted (using
        "Github-Flavored Markdown"), read <a
            href="https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/">this</a>
        about markdown basics.
