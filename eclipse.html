        <h2>Using Eclipse (Outside of Class)</h2>

        <p>There are two places you might want to use Eclipse
            outside of class: on a machine you control, and on a College
            computer. In the first case, you can just install Eclipse
            (as explained below), and it should work easily.</p>

        <p>
            In the second case (College labs), Eclipse is available in a
            network folder which can be accessed on all machines. ITS
            recommends that you copy that folder to the desktop of the
            machine you're using. Or, copy the folder to your USB drive,
            instead of following the install-on-USB instructions below.
            This might save you some time, and make it easier to keep
            your work safe. </p>
	
            <p>If you do run Eclipse from the desktop, make sure you delete your file sfrom
            the computer when you're done working.</p>
            
            <p> If you
            need to work at other labs, you will need to have Eclipse
            installed on your USB drive (again, see below)<./p>

            <h3>Installing Eclipse</h3>

            <p>
            Installing Eclipse is fairly straightforward. First
            download
            the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">installer</a>
            for Eclipse Neon. If you're on a Mac, you'll need to unzip
            the downloaded file (just double-click it). Then run the
            installer. You should see options for several variants of
            Eclipse: pick "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers," which
            is probably the second option you'll see. You'll be asked
            for an installation folder. The default choice is
            perfectly fine, unless you know you want to put it
            somewhere else. During the brief installation process,
            you'll be asked to accept a license or two. When
            installation is complete, click "Launch," and Eclipse will
            run for the first time. You'll be asked to select a
            "workspace directory," which is where all your Eclipse
            projects will be kept; again, the default is fine unless
            you have a strong opinion otherwise.  (If you still have a
            lingering Eclipse Installer window open, you can close it
            now.)
            </p>


	<p>You should also make sure you have the latest version of
	the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is Java 8. You can
	  get it <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">here</a>.

        <h3>Other Items for your USB Drive</h3>

        <p>
            If you're using Eclipse on USB, you should make sure that
            your Eclipse workspace is <em>also</em> on your USB drive.
            Once you select a place for it, you can tell Eclipse to make
            that your default workspace, so it will stop asking you each
            time you start.
        </p>

        <p>
            You may want to make sure Java 8 is on your USB drive, so
                when you run the JDK installer,  make sure it installs <em>on
                your USB drive</em>. Record the folder name (probably
            something like
            <code>e:\java\jdk1.8.0\</code>
            ).
        </p>
        <p>
            One last step: you need to be able to tell the operating
            system where to find this version of Java, so you'll write a
            very short script. Using Notepad, create a file in the root
            directory of your USB drive called something like
            <code>javaUSB.bat</code>
            (the name doesn't really matter, but it needs to end in
            <code>.bat</code>
            ). In that file, type one line:
        </p>


        <code>set Path=java\jdk1.8.0\bin;%Path% </code>

        <p>Note: don't use a drive letter, but otherwise make sure
            the path matches the name of the folder where you installed
            Java.</p>

        <p>In order to run Eclipse, and make sure that you have the
            right version of Java, open a command window and issue three
            commands:</p>

        <code>
            E: <br />javaUSB <br /> eclipse\eclipse.exe<br />
        </code>

        <p>Again, the drive letter and particular paths may vary
            depending on how you've set up your USB drive.</p>
