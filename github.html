        <h2>About GitHub</h2>

        <p>
           As part of the introductory survey, you should have given me your GitHub username. If you haven't done so yet, please complete that survey!
        </p>

      <p>We'll spend a class session practicing git/GitHub actions,
      but before then, here's a little basic info:</p>
        <p>
            GitHub is, roughly speaking, a hosted source code management
            solution (though it can manage all kinds of project, not
            just software development). It uses the rather awesome
            software <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>. It is a <em>distributed</em>
            source code management tool, which means that it's very easy
            to work on code with multiple collaborators (a few, a few
            hundred...), very easy to work on your code from multiple
            locations, and also very easy to keep track of your work,
            try different approaches, and decide what you want to keep
            and what you want to discard. For the purposes of this
            class, there are two fairly limited uses we'll have for
            GitHub:

            <ul>
                <li>It's easy for me to update the course website, and for you to see exactly what changes have been made.</li>
                <li>I'll be able to distribute code for programming
                    projects, and grade your work, without paper, email,
                    etc.</li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <p>So, first: all the published material for the course
            (including this page) is in a GitHub repository at</p>

        <p>
            <a
                href="https://github.com/BC-CISC3120-F16/BC-CISC3120-F16.github.io">https://github.com/BC-CISC3120-F16/BC-CISC3120-F16.github.io</a>
        </p>

        <p>As you'll soon learn, this page lets you see exactly what changes I've made to the course web pages as the semester progresses.</p>

        <p>Second: assignments. Once I have your GitHub username, I will
        make you part of the class "organization" on GitHub. For each
        project I assign, I will create a "private repository" for you,
        with a copy of the assignment and any 'skeleton' code the
        project needs. You will "clone" this repository to whichever
        computer you're using, make changes to the project there, and
        regularly "push" your work to your private repository on GitHub.
        If you have questions, you can ask me about them and I can just
        look at your code on GitHub. When it comes time to grade, I will
        clone your repository to my computer, then push it back with my
        grading comments. And yes, I'll give you instructions about how
        to do all of this: it takes a little time to get used to, but
        it's a very powerful way of working with code.</p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Using GitHub</h2>

        <p>
            Please read the first two chapters of the <a
                href="http://git-scm.com/doc">git book</a> ("Getting
            Started" and "Git Basics"). This will give you a basic sense
            of what git is for. Don't worry about memorizing
            command-line stuff; mainly, we'll be interacting with git
            through Eclipse and GitHub rather than the command line. But
            the main concepts (like 'repository,' 'clone,' 'commit') are
            fundamental no matter what interface to git you're using.
        </p>

        <p>Our GitHub lab will give you some practice with these
        concepts. When we start working on programming projects,
        you'll apply these concepts, following the instructions below.
        

        <h3>GitHub and Your Projects</h3>

        <p>
            For at least the first two programming assignments (#0 and #1), I will give you a private
            repository on GitHub. Open your GitHub account and find the
            main page for this repository. Copy the URL of the page
            (something like
            <code>http://github.com/myaccount/project0-intro</code>
            ).
        </p>

        <p>Now, open Eclipse and import the project/repository. Go
            to File->Import and, under the "Git" option select "Projects
            from Git" In the window that pops up, select "Clone URI"
            (and click Next). In the next window, paste in the URL you
            copied from GitHub (in the "URI" field). You will need to
            enter your GitHub username and password in the bottom of the
            window.</p>

        <p>
            That gets your project hooked up with git and GitHub. You
            should have a project named something like
            <code>project0-intro</code>
            .
        </p>

        <p>
            Now comes the good stuff. Every time you get a little bit of
            progress made on your work, you should <b>Commit</b> it.
            (Explore my repository for the class webpage to see some
            example commits.) To do this, right-click on any file in
            your project (or the project folder itself), and from the
            "Team" submenu select "Commit..." (there is also a keyboard
            shortcut, which will depend on your operating system ). This
            will bring up a window. Enter a brief explanation of what
            changes you made (again, look at my commits); you can add a
            longer explanation if you like, Just leave a blank line
            after your brief description, then write as much as you
            like. If you then click the "Commit" button, you will record
            this 'snapshot' of your current state of work in your <em>local</em>
            copy of the project. If you select "Commit and Push," this
            snapshot will also be recorded on GitHub--this is both an
            easy form of backup, and it also lets me ssee how your work
            is progressing.
