<p>Below are the grading policies determined by the students of each
  section during the first day of class. All sections will be curved
  independently; students are not "competing" across sections.</p>

<p>Note that grades are broken into three broad categories: Individual Performance, Team Performance, and Peer Evaluation. <em>Individual Performance</em> includes the midterm exam, the final exam, individual RATs, and homework/programming assignments. <em>Team Performance</em> includes the team RATs and Application Activity Points (each day we spend on application activities will include at least opportunity for teams to earn a point--perhaps by getting an answer correct, or by giving a particularly good example. While I will determine these opportunities in advance, I will <em>not</em> share them with the class until the points have been earned.). <em>Peer Evaluation</em> is the score you're given by your teammates at the end of the semester by your teammates. If you receive a combined score of 10, you will get a 95% for this grade; lower scores will earn lower scores. Points over 10 will be added as extra credit points to your final course grade.</p>

  <p>For the grade weight
  calculation, the "Category Weight" is the number written down on the Grade Weight Worksheet. The "Absolute Weight" is the amount this item contributes to your final grade. For examle, if the "Category Weight" for "Individual" is 60% and the "Category Weight" for the Final Exam is 50%, the "Absolute Weight" for the final exam is 50% * 60% = 30%</p>
