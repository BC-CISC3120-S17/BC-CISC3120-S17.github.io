Dear students, 

I'm looking forward to our first meeting in a couple weeks! To prepare for class, please review the syllabus/calendar/etc I've posted at http://bc-cisc3120-s17.github.io/.

In particular, please take note of a few specific things:

1. I'll be teaching the class using "Team-Based Learning." Several of you have had this experience with me before; others have been in other classes organized this way. If you're new to Team-Based Learning, please read the main page of the site carefully (and if you've been in my courses before, you might want to read to see a few small changes I've made).

2. If you haven't acquired the book yet, please do so ASAP--please read the Introduction before our first class.

3. Please fill out the short survey you'll find in the calendar under "Class 2." (You can link directly to the calendar at http://bc-cisc3120-s17.github.io/calendar. This calendar will be updated frequently with additional links and changes. I will email you to let you know of major changes, but you should check every couple days.)

4. Finally, we'll be using Eclipse as our development environment; if you have a computer on which you can install software, please follow the instructions posted at https://bc-cisc3120-s17.github.io/eclipse.html. (Note that you will be required to submit your work as Eclipse projects; thus using Eclipse is a requirement of the course.)

Until we meet,
Scott Dexter
