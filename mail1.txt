Dear students, 

I'm looking forward to our first meeting on Thursday! To prepare for class, please review the syllabus/calendar/etc I've posted at http://bc-cisc3120-f16.github.io/ -- in particular, take a look at http://bc-cisc3120-f16.github.io/calendar to see what we'll be doing during our first meeting. (Please note that I will be updating the calendar frequently.)

If you haven't acquired the book yet, please do so ASAP--ideally, you'll have read the Introduction before Thursday's class. Also, please fill out the short survey you'll find in the calendar under "Class 2." 

Finally, we'll be using Eclipse as our development environment; if you have a computer on which you can install software, please follow the instructions posted at https://bc-cisc3120-f16.github.io/eclipse.html.

Until Thursday, 
Scott Dexter
