    <p><em>Team-Based Learning</em> is an approach to learning and teaching that has been used for decades in a wide variety of disciplines and schools. The root idea is that class time will be used mainly for teams of students to work together on authentic/interesting problems. This, of course, requires that individuals students come prepared to make meaningful contributions to their team's work. Read <a href="slides/TBLFacts.pdf">this short handout</a> to get a sense of how class sessions will work with TBL.</p>


    <p>We'll have to do some setup to make sure TBL works smoothly for
  us. First, we'll <em>form teams</em>. These teams will be permanent,
  for the whole semester. We'll form them together, in a way that
  tries to make each team as diverse as possible (research shows that
  diverse teams do better). Second, each team will <em>choose its
  name</em>. Third, we'll have a sample team-based experience :). At
    the end of the first class, we'll use the teams to decide on how
      much weight each course element should have in your final grade.</p>

<p>There are three categories of activities that will contribute to
  your grade: (1) individual activity; (2) team activity; (3) peer
  evaluation.</p>

    <p><em>Individual Activity</em> encompasses the TBL iRATs,
    midterm and final exams, and individual programming assignments.
    Each of these will be graded by me in the way you'd expect (we'll
    talk more later about how progamming assignments will be graded).</p>

    
    <p><em>Team Activity</em> encompasses the TBL tRATs and TBL
    Application Activities. Each member of the team will get the same
    grade for each of these. The tRATs will be graded as described on
    the <a href="slides/TBLFacts.pdf">TBL handout</a>.  Application
    Activities offer daily opportunities for points: each day we spend on Application Activities will have a chance for teams to earn a point. Sometimes all teams will get the point-of-the-day; sometimes none will. Moreover, I may occasionally assign a team a bonus point (for  exemplary work) or a
    demerit (for things like disruptive behavior or extremely poor attendance) for the day. </p>

    
    <p><em>Peer Evaluation</em> provides you the chance to grade your
      teammates. These evaluations <em>will</em> affect final course
      grades. Students who are poorly prepared or otherwise don't
      contribute to the team tend to get very low marks from their
      teammates; students who are well-prepared and contribute to the
      team's success tend to get good marks from their peers. In our
      second class session , we'll also use the teams to decide the
      five <em>peer evaluation criteria</em> to be used when you
      evaluate each other on your team participation. We'll have a
      "practice" peer evaluation 5 or 6 weeks into the semester, so
      that you learn how your teammates perceive you and make any
      improvements you wish. The "real" peer evaluation will happen
      on the last day of class.</p>
